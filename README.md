# IP Tracker

This GitHub repository contains the source code for a website built using Vue, Tailwind CSS, and Leaflet. The website allows users to enter an IP address and returns information about the location and ISP associated with that IP address. If no IP address is provided, the website automatically detects the user's IP address and displays the same information. The website's intuitive and responsive design, combined with the powerful Leaflet library, makes it easy to quickly and accurately retrieve information about any IP address. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it an excellent starting point for building your own IP lookup tool.

## Running

1. **Clone the repository**: First, you'll need to clone the repository containing the Vue website code. Navigate to the desired directory in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
```

2. **Install dependencies**: Next, you'll need to install the project's dependencies. Navigate to the cloned repository directory and run the following command inside the `app` folder:

```bash
    cd app/
    npm install
```

3. **Run the website**: Finally, you can run the website using a local development server. Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
    npm run serve
```

This command will start a development server, and you can access the website by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
